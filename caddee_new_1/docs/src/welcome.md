The Comprehensive Analysis high-Dimensional Design Environment for Engineering systems (CADDEE) framework is python-based framework for the conceptual design of aircraft and other 
complex engineering systems. It leverages recent advances in automated adjoint-based sensitivity analysis to systematically explore the high-dimensional design space of complex engineering system by considering the entire mission or design cycle, and by using pyhsics-based models of varying fidelity.
