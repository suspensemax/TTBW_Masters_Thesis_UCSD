# 1. Tail actuates relative to fuselage
# -- Actuation axis
# -- -- NOTE: Definitely want to use quaternions where the axis is a MappedArray.
# -- Actuation value
# -- Do we want to specify an actuator object that has a location on the fuselage and another location on the tail?
# -- -- I think this is more intuitive from the perspective of a system configuration. The location can still be a DV, but this needs to work with param.
# -- -- In the case of something like a motor, the location on each component specifies the axis? Only if the points are not directly stacked.
# -- -- -- It seems like we may want to separately along axis specification for cases like tilt-win where the axis of rotation should really only dependent
#           on the wing and not on its position along the fuselage.
# -- -- -- Should locations on each component be optional, and if so, they are auto-detected? If specified, can they be DV and/or move in the parameterization?

# Configuration creations and prescribed actuations
''' Implement everything below this point. '''

# For modularity and cleanliness, want to have the functionality so that CADDEE is not absolutely needed in order to perform the functionalities
# (CADDEE calls these functionalities and automates it). One aspect is the changing configuration over time/life of the system. Long term, I want
# to support a continuous representation of the system w.r.t. time. This would likely use control points. This method should still work for the
# long term goal because these discrete representations can serve as the control points in a continuous representation. Just to include this wacky idea,
# if we think about the system as a collection of 2D manifolds (pick B-spline surfaces as an example), and we want to continuous represent the system
# over a dynamic segment, then the system can be represented as a collection of 3D manifolds (pick B-spline volumes as an example), where the additional
# parametric axis corresponds to the time axis. Since the geometry itself can include volumes and we want to also continously represent the properties,
# this would require the use of n-dimensional manifolds to represent the system.
configuration_names = ["hover_configuration", "cruise_configuration"]
system_representations = system_representation.create_instances(names=configuration_names)
hover_configuration = system_representations['hover_configuration']
cruise_configuration = system_representations['cruise_configuration']
# NOTE: having multiple instances of system configuration specifically also implied multiple instances of the power_systems_architecture representation. This is beneficial
# because it allows for dynamically changing power_systems_architecture where connections are made or not made (think of transformers as a funny example). This makes
# things a little more complicated because now the TES may have to handle discretely changing power_systems_architecture rather than solving a single power_systems_architecture over time.
# -- Because the long term idea is to have a continous representation of the configuration over time, this means that we would want to have a 
#       continous representation of the power_systems_architecture over time (this is a challenge because a power_systems_architecture is inherently discrete). A potential solution to this
#       could be to use ideas from topology optimization (assign a topological density to each power_systems_architecture connection that can vary with time).
# NOTE: Perhaps there can be a separate method or keyword for a dynamic instances. This could help with specifying a dynamic actuation profile as a
#           vector rather than individually an unreasonable number of times. Perhaps there can be a subsequent method that is used to "string together"
#           configurations into a dynamic configuration. I think I like this second idea.


# Want to try to not create separate components because a single "thing" can be a "lifting surface" and also a "rotor" and a "thermal insulator", etc.
# -- Instead, the solvers see the components through a certain lens and perform their analysis.
# -- With this philosophy, it seems that actuators should be passed into a PrescribedRotation solver or PrescribedTranslation or PrescribedDisplacement
# -- I then know that I want to have a single PrescribedActuation "solver", so perhaps these sub-solvers go into the larger solver?
# As a note, one motivation for this is to stay independent whether its a prescribed actuation or solved using E-M, etc.
# To further this, this is recognizing that no part of the system really has inherent meaning. As the end of the day, each component is an arbitrary
#   collection of atoms. In life as we perceive it, we assign meaning to objects and treat them as such. For instance, an aerodynamicist may see an object
#   as a wing, while a thermodynamicist may see it as a thermal insulator, while a soldier sees it as a shield, and an alien sees it as something else 
#   entirely. For extensibility, this recognition is important because the user is tasked with assigning meaning to components of the system through
#   deciding to perform specialized analysis that is specific to the meaning. If we try to create a type of component for every type of way each thing
#   can be perceived, we will end up with an incredibly large library of components, and a single component will simultaneously have multiple definitions.
#   (for instance, a wing component may be redefined as a black body for heat transfer within the same script/representation).

# The nature of this operation is that it is changing the actual system in a prescribed manner. The canonical case is prescribed actuation although
# we can also consider prescribed displacement (is that actuation in that sense?). I wonder if there are perhaps changes that could be in materials
# or properties that could influence the name of this method.
# It seems that also want an API for separately making connections (building the power_systems_architecture). Perhaps the connections by default apply to every connection
#   but if the user wants, they may manually specify a subset of configurations if they only want them to apply then.
# -- NOTE: We want to automate most of the connections like phyiscal connections (mechanical work transfer) anyways.

# NOTE: In a sense, each rotation/translation/displacement/etc. is a solver. I'm leaning towards that each solver is added individually to the 
# configuration, then in the backend, all those changes are organized a vectorized.
